# DYNAMIC-PROJECTS
This contains simple Dynamic Webpages developed using technologies like HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT

A dynamic website is a type of website that can change its content and appearance in real-time based on user interactions, database updates, or other external factors. 
Unlike static websites, which have fixed content, dynamic websites use server-side scripting languages and databases to generate web pages on the fly. 
This allows for interactive features such as user login systems, e-commerce functionality, content management, and personalized user experiences. 
Dynamic websites are commonly used for online stores, social media platforms, news websites, and any site that needs to deliver customized content to users.
